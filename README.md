# Doinmin
A productivity app that helps you deal with overwhelming gigantic tasks.
I got idea from my days of learning guitar. 
Specify the task you want to do.
Specify the amount of minutes for which you want to focus on that task.
It helps you get better results.
Moreover, it also helps you to deal with procrastination.
The app is not responsive because there is a main feature which doesn't work on android or ios platforms.
Further improvments to the app are welcome.
Here' the link to the app: http://doinmin.com/
